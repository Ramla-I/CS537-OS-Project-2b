Environment variable was set up by using the export command and making LD_LIBRARY_PATH equal to our current directory

Mem_Init:
- First checked if size was a multiple of pages and changed value if it wasn't so
- Used mmap to get free memory
- Set freeList pointing to beginning of this allocated space. Set Size and next.

Mem_Alloc:
- Made sure size was a multiple of 8 bytes
- found region according to method specified and stored in a pointer 'ptr'. The region before it was store in pointer 'previous'.
- allocated region and filled in header
- created a list_t pointer for remaining part of that free space and update its size and next.
- set previous->next to remaining free space

Mem_Free:
- Found region that comes right before and right after newly freed space
- checked if this newly freed space came between two regions in the freeList or at the end or at the beginning or was the only entry in the freeList
- checked for coalescing and upated size and next variables of free regions


Mem_Dump:
-looped through free list and printed out address, size and next region
